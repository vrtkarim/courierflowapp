The scanning interface incorporates a real-time camera feed with QR code detection overlay. The bottom panel displays previously scanned packages and can be expanded with a swipe-up gesture. The app bar includes the courier's profile image for quick access to user information.

### Courier Profile

The profile page provides comprehensive information about the courier, including performance metrics, delivery history, and personal details. This screen allows couriers to track their efficiency and manage their account settings.

### Optimized Route Map

The navigation map displays the courier's current location (represented by the delivery vehicle icon) and upcoming delivery points (package icons). The optimized route is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm for the most efficient path between multiple stops, highlighted with a distinctive orange line. A floating action button allows quick re-centering on the current location.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern for predictable state changes
- **Map Visualization**: Flutter Map with OpenStreetMap integration
- **Scanning**: Mobile Scanner package with custom overlay

### Backend Integration
- **API Communication**: RESTful API interaction with Spring Boot backend
- **Authentication**: JWT token handling with secure storage
- **Data Format**: GPX for route data, JSON for API responses

### Location Services
- Real-time GPS tracking with Geolocator package
- Custom map markers for improved visibility
- Route visualization with polylines
